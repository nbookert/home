Hey! I'm Nyteisha Bookert, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at NC A&T State University. I am a graduate research assistant in the Secure and Usable Social Media & Networks (SUSMaN) Lab.

My research aims to increase transparency and raise awareness of the security and privacy risk of IoT devices. Currently, I am developing a tool to identify privacy vulnerabilities in connected medical devices.  I'm a proud alumna of SC State University and NCA&T.
